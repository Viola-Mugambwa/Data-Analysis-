### Data Analysis

### Findings
- Age group 45-54,registered the lowest unemployment rate while,age 16-19 registered the highest unemployment throughout the 17 year period.
- Looking at the months, July registered the lowest unemployment rate while March recorded the highest rates throughout the years.
- 2019 registered the lowest compared to 2011 that recorded the highest unemployment rate in the 17 year period.This analysis takes into account the years that recorded 12 months.

### Observations
- Overall data shows that unemployment rates continued to increase as the years  progressed for age of 16-19 to 20-24,which can be attributed to time in school ,high school, college and university. On the other hand, low unemployment rates registered in age group 45-54 & 55-64 is common perception that by this time or age one is set in their career and working towards retirement security.

### Limitations
- 2008 & 2024 recorded  (11 & 3 months) consequentively. This resulted in inconclusive data if the count of months was not taken into account. However, analysis by month was done to get an overall view of the unemployment rate throughout the 17 year period. Which resulted in March and February scoring highest among all the 17 years. Its worth noting that the overall Unemployment rates in the 17 year period was based on the years that had a full 12 month recording.
