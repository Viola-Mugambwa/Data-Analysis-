### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Year with lowest & highest unemployment rate
- Month with the lowest & highest unemployment rate
- Age group with lowest & highest unemployment rate
### Data Analysis

### Findings
- Highest unemployment was registered among  16-19 and 20-25 age groups.
- Lowest unemployment was registered among 45-55 and 35-40 age groups throughout the 17 years.
- Years, 2017, 2019, 2023,registered the lowest unemployment rate, taking into account that all 12 months data per year was recorded.
- Furthermore the data shows an overall spike in high unemployment rates from 2017 to 2024.
- looking at the overall performance of months, august and february registered high unemployment rates, while march and april scored low.
### Observations
 -Overall the data shows that unemployment rates continued to increase as the years  progressed for age of 16-19 to 20-24,which can be attributed to time in school. On the other hand, low unemployment rates registered in age group 35-44 & 45-55 which can be attributed to being the most common age range when people are set in their careers and working towards retirement security.

### Limitations
- 2008 & 2024 recorded  (11 & 3 months) consequentively. This affected the analysis process by year and feared to give inconclusive data. However, analysis by month was done to get an overall unemployment rate throughout the 17 year period by month . Its worth noting that the overall annual perfomance in the 17 year period was based on the months that had a full 12 month unemployment recording.
